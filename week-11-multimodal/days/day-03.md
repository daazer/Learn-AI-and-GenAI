# week-11-multimodal - Day 03: Contrastive Loss Training

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [InfoNCE short explainer](https://www.abhik.xyz/concepts/losses/contrastive-loss) - 8-12 min.
- [CrossEntropyLoss docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html) - concept.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write role of temperature in one sentence.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-11-multimodal/code/day03_contrastive.py`.
2. Implement symmetric contrastive loss and short training loop.
3. Save loss curve to `artifacts/day-03-contrastive-loss.png`.

## Practice Drills
- Try temperature 0.07 and 0.2; compare dynamics.

## Done When
- [ ] Contrastive training runs and logs metrics.
