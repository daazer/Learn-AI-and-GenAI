# week-06-nn-basics - Day 06: Training Stability Diagnostics

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Exploding gradients overview](https://machinelearningmastery.com/exploding-gradients-in-neural-networks/) - skim.
- [Initialization docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.init.html) - Xavier/He concept.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write 2 signs of unstable training you can detect quickly.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-06-nn-basics/code/day06_stability.py`.
2. Log gradient norms and compare default vs Xavier-like init.
3. Save plot to `artifacts/day-06-stability.png`.

## Practice Drills
- Run one high-LR unstable case and compare.

## Done When
- [ ] Gradient norm diagnostics and plot exist.
