# week-06-nn-basics - Day 02: Two-Layer Forward Pass

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Neural nets intuition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) - first 10 min.
- [NumPy dot](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html) - refresh.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write a shape table for each layer before coding.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-06-nn-basics/code/day02_forward.py`.
2. Implement `TwoLayerNet` forward pass and print tensor shapes at each step.
3. Save shape trace to `artifacts/day-02-forward-shapes.md`.

## Practice Drills
- Run with two batch sizes and verify shape consistency.

## Done When
- [ ] Forward pass is implemented with validated shapes.
