# Learn-AI-and-GenAI

A 90-day, code-first, from-scratch guidebook for learning modern generative AI.

## Start Here
- Open `plans/90-day-genai-roadmap.md` for the full program.
- Execute one week at a time from `week-01` through `week-12`.
- Keep every output inside each week's `notes/`, `code/`, and `artifacts/` folders.

## Program Outcome
By the end, you will have built and evaluated:
- Classical and neural language modeling baselines
- A tiny transformer-based text generator
- Foundational image generation systems (AE/VAE/tiny diffusion)
- A toy multimodal retrieval system
- End-to-end capstone reports with reproducible experiments
