# week-05-optimization - Day 05: Loss Functions in Practice

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Cross-entropy intro](https://machinelearningmastery.com/cross-entropy-for-machine-learning/) - skim.
- [Softmax + CE concept](https://cs231n.github.io/linear-classify/#softmax) - concept.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write one case where MSE is a poor classification loss.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-05-optimization/code/day05_losses.py`.
2. Implement `mse` and binary `cross_entropy` with epsilon clamp.
3. Save comparison examples to `artifacts/day-05-losses.md`.

## Practice Drills
- Test confidence extremes near 0 and 1 to verify stability.

## Done When
- [ ] Both losses implemented and compared.
