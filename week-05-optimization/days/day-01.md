# week-05-optimization - Day 01: Derivatives and Finite Differences

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [3Blue1Brown derivatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk) - first 10 min.
- [Partial derivatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative) - definition only.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write gradient direction meaning in one sentence.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-05-optimization/code/day01_derivatives.py`.
2. Implement analytic + numerical derivative comparison for `f(x)=x^2+3x+2`.
3. Save error table to `artifacts/day-01-derivative-errors.csv`.

## Practice Drills
- Sweep epsilon values and inspect error trend.

## Done When
- [ ] Derivative comparison script runs and exports errors.
