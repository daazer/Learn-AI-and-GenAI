# week-05-optimization - Day 04: Linear Regression From Scratch

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Linear regression basics](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression) - concept.
- [MSE formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error) - skim formula.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write model equation and gradients before coding.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-05-optimization/code/day04_linear_regression.py`.
2. Train on synthetic data with batch GD and log loss per epoch.
3. Save learned parameters and curve in `artifacts/day-04-linear-regression.*`.

## Practice Drills
- Compare learned vs ground-truth parameters.

## Done When
- [ ] Loss decreases and parameters are logged.
