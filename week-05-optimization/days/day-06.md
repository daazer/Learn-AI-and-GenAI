# week-05-optimization - Day 06: Logistic Regression From Scratch

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Logistic regression crash course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/logistic-regression) - 10 min.
- [Sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) - formula.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Capture pipeline: logits -> sigmoid -> threshold.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-05-optimization/code/day06_logistic_regression.py`.
2. Train on toy binary dataset; track loss, accuracy, precision, recall.
3. Save metrics curve to `artifacts/day-06-logreg-metrics.png`.

## Practice Drills
- Compare threshold 0.5 vs 0.7 results.

## Done When
- [ ] Training and metric tracking work end-to-end.
