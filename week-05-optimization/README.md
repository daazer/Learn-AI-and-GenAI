# Week 05 Optimization

Focus: Gradient-based learning fundamentals and objective design

## Week Mission
Build practical mastery of this week's concepts through code-first exercises, reproducible experiments, and documented takeaways.

## Prerequisites
- Previous week completed (or equivalent comfort with listed skills).
- Local Python environment ready (python, pip, virtual environment).
- Basic Git usage for tracking incremental progress.

## Learning Outcomes (Definition of Success)
- [ ] Understand gradient meaning and optimization dynamics.
- [ ] Implement and verify gradient-based updates numerically.
- [ ] Train linear and logistic regression models from scratch.
- [ ] Compare optimization behavior under different learning rates.

## Core Tasks
- [ ] 31. Learn calculus basics: derivatives and gradients.
- [ ] 32. Implement numerical gradient checking.
- [ ] 33. Learn gradient descent and learning rate schedules.
- [ ] 34. Implement gradient descent for linear regression.
- [ ] 35. Learn loss functions: MSE and cross entropy.
- [ ] 36. Implement logistic regression from scratch.
- [ ] 37. Write a summary note on optimization tradeoffs.

## Day-by-Day Execution Blueprint
- Day 1: Read and skim core concepts, define terms, and write a one-page mental model in notes/.
- Day 2: Implement the first half of core coding tasks with minimal abstractions.
- Day 3: Finish remaining coding tasks and validate with simple tests or assertions.
- Day 4: Run controlled experiments, track metrics, and save artifacts.
- Day 5: Refactor for clarity (naming, structure, docstrings, small helper functions).
- Day 6: Write a technical summary note: what worked, what failed, and why.
- Day 7: Review, tighten deliverables, and prepare handoff-ready week outputs.

## Guided Build Project
Create an optimization lab with gradient checks, LR schedule experiments, and logistic regression training curves.

## Deliverables
- notes/
- code/
- artifacts/

## Minimum File Outputs
- notes/theory-summary.md
- notes/mistakes-and-fixes.md
- notes/weekly-retrospective.md
- code/run_all (script or notebook)
- artifacts/results.md

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Numerical and analytical gradients closely match.
- [ ] Training curves logged for at least 3 LR values.
- [ ] Binary classifier reports accuracy/precision/recall.

## Reflection Prompts
- Which concept still feels intuitive weak, and what concrete example clarified it?
- Which implementation detail caused the most bugs, and how was it fixed?
- Which metric best indicated progress this week, and why?
- What should be simplified before building on this in the next week?

## Stretch Goals (Optional)
- Add one extra experiment that changes a meaningful assumption.
- Compare two implementation strategies and document tradeoffs.
- Add simple automation (Makefile or script) to run repetitive steps.

## End-of-Week Gate
Mark the week complete only when:
- All core tasks are checked.
- Deliverables exist in notes/, code/, and artifacts/.
- You can explain the week's key idea in plain language without notes.
