# week-08-transformers - Day 07: Autoregressive Generation + Summary

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Generation strategies](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate) - temperature and top-k sections.
- Review your week-8 logs/curves.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write default decoding settings and why you chose them.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-08-transformers/code/day07_generate.py` using trained checkpoint.
2. Generate 5 samples (200 chars each) and save to `artifacts/day-07-samples.txt`.
3. Write `notes/weekly-retrospective.md` and `artifacts/results.md` with run commands and outcomes.

## Practice Drills
- Compare temperature 0.7 vs 1.2 outputs.

## Done When
- [ ] Generation script works and retrospective is complete.
