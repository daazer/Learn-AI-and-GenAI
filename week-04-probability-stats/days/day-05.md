# week-04-probability-stats - Day 05: Bayes Rule Toy Case

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Bayes theorem video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library/conditional-probability-independent-events/v/bayes-theorem-and-testing) - 8-12 min.
- [Bayes formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) - formula section.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write prior/likelihood/posterior meanings before coding.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-04-probability-stats/code/day05_bayes.py`.
2. Implement `bayes(prior, likelihood, evidence)` and evaluate 3 prevalence scenarios.
3. Save table to `artifacts/day-05-bayes.md`.

## Practice Drills
- Vary prevalence and inspect posterior shifts.

## Done When
- [ ] Bayes table includes multiple scenarios.
