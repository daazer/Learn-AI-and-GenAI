# week-04-probability-stats - Day 01: Probability and Conditional Probability

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Khan probability intro](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library) - 8-10 min.
- [Conditional probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability) - definition/examples.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write one conditional probability example from real life.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-04-probability-stats/code/day01_probability.py`.
2. Implement `prob` and `conditional_prob` helpers with toy card/dice examples.
3. Save outputs to `week-04-probability-stats/artifacts/day-01-probability.txt`.

## Practice Drills
- Add assertions for impossible and certain events.

## Done When
- [ ] Helpers and assertions pass.
