# week-04-probability-stats - Day 03: Expectation, Variance, Covariance

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Expectation intro](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/random-variables-stats-library) - skim.
- [NumPy cov docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.cov.html) - examples.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write difference between variance and covariance in one line.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-04-probability-stats/code/day03_moments.py`.
2. Implement manual mean/variance and compare with NumPy.
3. Save covariance matrix to `artifacts/day-03-covariance.csv`.

## Practice Drills
- Generate positive and negative correlation datasets.

## Done When
- [ ] Manual and NumPy outputs align.
