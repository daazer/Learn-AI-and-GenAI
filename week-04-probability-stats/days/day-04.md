# week-04-probability-stats - Day 04: Estimator Stability

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Bias-variance tradeoff intro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff) - intro only.
- [Sampling distribution note](https://www.statisticshowto.com/sampling-distribution/) - skim.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Capture one reason small samples are unstable.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-04-probability-stats/code/day04_estimators.py`.
2. Simulate repeated sampling for sizes 10/50/500 and record estimate error.
3. Save spread plot to `artifacts/day-04-estimator-spread.png`.

## Practice Drills
- Increase trials and compare stability.

## Done When
- [ ] Estimator spread analysis complete.
