# Week 04 Probability and Statistics

Focus: Uncertainty, distributions, and information measures for learning systems

## Week Mission
Build practical mastery of this week's concepts through code-first exercises, reproducible experiments, and documented takeaways.

## Prerequisites
- Previous week completed (or equivalent comfort with listed skills).
- Local Python environment ready (python, pip, virtual environment).
- Basic Git usage for tracking incremental progress.

## Learning Outcomes (Definition of Success)
- [ ] Apply core probability rules to simple ML scenarios.
- [ ] Estimate key statistics from synthetic samples.
- [ ] Compute entropy, cross-entropy, and KL divergence correctly.
- [ ] Use Bayes rule for a transparent toy inference problem.

## Core Tasks
- [ ] 23. Learn probability basics: events, conditional probability.
- [ ] 24. Implement sampling from simple distributions.
- [ ] 25. Learn expectation, variance, covariance.
- [ ] 26. Implement estimation of mean and variance from samples.
- [ ] 27. Learn Bayes rule and apply to a toy example.
- [ ] 28. Learn entropy and cross entropy.
- [ ] 29. Implement KL divergence on simple distributions.
- [ ] 30. Write a summary note on uncertainty in models.

## Day-by-Day Execution Blueprint
- Day 1: Read and skim core concepts, define terms, and write a one-page mental model in notes/.
- Day 2: Implement the first half of core coding tasks with minimal abstractions.
- Day 3: Finish remaining coding tasks and validate with simple tests or assertions.
- Day 4: Run controlled experiments, track metrics, and save artifacts.
- Day 5: Refactor for clarity (naming, structure, docstrings, small helper functions).
- Day 6: Write a technical summary note: what worked, what failed, and why.
- Day 7: Review, tighten deliverables, and prepare handoff-ready week outputs.

## Guided Build Project
Build a probability sandbox notebook/scripts for sampling, estimation, Bayes updates, and information metrics.

## Deliverables
- notes/
- code/
- artifacts/

## Minimum File Outputs
- notes/theory-summary.md
- notes/mistakes-and-fixes.md
- notes/weekly-retrospective.md
- code/run_all (script or notebook)
- artifacts/results.md

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Sampling experiments include at least 3 distributions.
- [ ] KL implementation validated on known toy distributions.
- [ ] Uncertainty note includes at least 3 model-related examples.

## Reflection Prompts
- Which concept still feels intuitive weak, and what concrete example clarified it?
- Which implementation detail caused the most bugs, and how was it fixed?
- Which metric best indicated progress this week, and why?
- What should be simplified before building on this in the next week?

## Stretch Goals (Optional)
- Add one extra experiment that changes a meaningful assumption.
- Compare two implementation strategies and document tradeoffs.
- Add simple automation (Makefile or script) to run repetitive steps.

## End-of-Week Gate
Mark the week complete only when:
- All core tasks are checked.
- Deliverables exist in notes/, code/, and artifacts/.
- You can explain the week's key idea in plain language without notes.
