# week-07-language-models - Day 02: Unigram + Bigram Implementation

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Bigram intro](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-introduction-to-n-gram-language-models-604d3f0d9f6e) - skim.
- [Counter refresher](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter) - usage.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write bigram probability formula before coding.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-07-language-models/code/day02_unigram_bigram.py`.
2. Implement bigram counts and sentence scoring for unigram vs bigram.
3. Save score comparison to `artifacts/day-02-sentence-scores.md`.

## Practice Drills
- Score one seen and one unseen sentence.

## Done When
- [ ] Uni/bigram scoring works.
