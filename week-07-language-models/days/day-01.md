- [SLP n-gram chapter](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf) - first pages.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write one tradeoff of larger n in n-gram models.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-07-language-models/code/day01_ngram_intro.py`.
2. Build unigram counts/probabilities from tiny corpus and export top-20 to CSV.
3. Save `artifacts/day-01-unigram-top20.csv`.

## Practice Drills
- Verify probabilities sum near 1.

## Done When
- [ ] Unigram pipeline runs and outputs CSV.
