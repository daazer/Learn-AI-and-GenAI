# week-07-language-models - Day 07: Week 7 Synthesis

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Sequence modeling recap](https://distill.pub/2019/memorization-in-rnns/) - skim intro.
- Review all week-7 artifacts.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- List 3 differences between n-gram and RNN behavior from your results.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Write `week-07-language-models/notes/weekly-retrospective.md`.
2. Create `code/run_all.ps1` and save status in `artifacts/results.md`.
3. Create `notes/sequence-modeling-summary.md` with key equations + caveats.

## Practice Drills
- Annotate your best and worst generated sample with reasons.

## Done When
- [ ] Retrospective and summary docs are complete.
