# week-07-language-models - Day 05: RNN Cell From Scratch

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [D2L RNN chapter](https://d2l.ai/chapter_recurrent-neural-networks/rnn.html) - concept skim.
- [RNN intuition](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) - vanilla RNN section.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write hidden-state update equation before coding.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-07-language-models/code/day05_rnn_cell.py`.
2. Implement vanilla RNN forward on one-hot char sequence.
3. Save shape and sample logits to `artifacts/day-05-rnn-forward.txt`.

## Practice Drills
- Run on lengths 5 and 20 and compare shapes.

## Done When
- [ ] RNN forward pass works with correct dimensions.
