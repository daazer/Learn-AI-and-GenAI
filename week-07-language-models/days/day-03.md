# week-07-language-models - Day 03: Smoothing

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Additive smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing) - formula section.
- [SLP smoothing pages](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf) - smoothing section skim.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write one downside of add-one smoothing.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-07-language-models/code/day03_smoothing.py`.
2. Implement add-k smoothing and compare unsmoothed vs smoothed scores.
3. Save metrics to `artifacts/day-03-smoothing.csv`.

## Practice Drills
- Try k=0.1,0.5,1.0 and compare outcomes.

## Done When
- [ ] Smoothing with tunable k is implemented.
