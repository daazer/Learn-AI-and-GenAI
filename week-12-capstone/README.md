# Week 12 Capstone

Focus: Integrating the full stack into end-to-end mini generative systems

## Week Mission
Build practical mastery of this week's concepts through code-first exercises, reproducible experiments, and documented takeaways.

## Prerequisites
- Previous week completed (or equivalent comfort with listed skills).
- Local Python environment ready (python, pip, virtual environment).
- Basic Git usage for tracking incremental progress.

## Learning Outcomes (Definition of Success)
- [ ] Plan and execute scoped end-to-end GenAI projects.
- [ ] Train and evaluate at least one text and one image generator.
- [ ] Present results clearly with limitations and next-step recommendations.
- [ ] Demonstrate reproducibility and engineering quality in final artifacts.

## Core Tasks
- [ ] 83. Define a capstone scope for a mini GPT style model.
- [ ] 84. Prepare and clean a small text dataset.
- [ ] 85. Train a small transformer end to end.
- [ ] 86. Evaluate text generation quality and perplexity.
- [ ] 87. Define a capstone scope for a mini image generator.
- [ ] 88. Prepare a small image dataset.
- [ ] 89. Train a small image generator and sample outputs.
- [ ] 90. Write a final report with results and next steps.

## Day-by-Day Execution Blueprint
- Day 1: Read and skim core concepts, define terms, and write a one-page mental model in notes/.
- Day 2: Implement the first half of core coding tasks with minimal abstractions.
- Day 3: Finish remaining coding tasks and validate with simple tests or assertions.
- Day 4: Run controlled experiments, track metrics, and save artifacts.
- Day 5: Refactor for clarity (naming, structure, docstrings, small helper functions).
- Day 6: Write a technical summary note: what worked, what failed, and why.
- Day 7: Review, tighten deliverables, and prepare handoff-ready week outputs.

## Guided Build Project
Deliver two mini capstones (text + image) with reproducible training scripts and a final report.

## Deliverables
- notes/
- code/
- artifacts/

## Minimum File Outputs
- notes/theory-summary.md
- notes/mistakes-and-fixes.md
- notes/weekly-retrospective.md
- code/run_all (script or notebook)
- artifacts/results.md

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Both capstones run from documented commands.
- [ ] Final report includes metrics, samples, failure analysis, and roadmap.
- [ ] Repository is organized for external review/use.

## Reflection Prompts
- Which concept still feels intuitive weak, and what concrete example clarified it?
- Which implementation detail caused the most bugs, and how was it fixed?
- Which metric best indicated progress this week, and why?
- What should be simplified before building on this in the next week?

## Stretch Goals (Optional)
- Add one extra experiment that changes a meaningful assumption.
- Compare two implementation strategies and document tradeoffs.
- Add simple automation (Makefile or script) to run repetitive steps.

## End-of-Week Gate
Mark the week complete only when:
- All core tasks are checked.
- Deliverables exist in notes/, code/, and artifacts/.
- You can explain the week's key idea in plain language without notes.
