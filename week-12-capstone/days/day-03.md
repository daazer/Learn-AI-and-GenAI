# week-12-capstone - Day 03: Train Text Model

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Training loop refresher](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/introyt/trainingyt.html) - skim.
- [Gradient accumulation concept](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/usage_guides/gradient_accumulation) - optional skim.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Define checkpoint frequency before run.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-12-capstone/code/day03_train_text_model.py`.
2. Train transformer using `text_config.yaml` and log train/val loss.
3. Save checkpoints to `artifacts/checkpoints-text/` and curve to `artifacts/day-03-text-training.png`.

## Practice Drills
- Resume from one checkpoint and verify step continuity.

## Done When
- [ ] Training run produces checkpoints and curves.
