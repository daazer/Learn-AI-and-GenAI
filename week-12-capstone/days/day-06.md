# week-12-capstone - Day 06: Train Image Generator

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Torchvision datasets](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html) - skim.
- [Torchvision transforms](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html) - skim.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Fix preprocessing pipeline and version it in notes.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-12-capstone/code/day06_train_image_model.py`.
2. Train selected image model and save checkpoints in `artifacts/checkpoints-image/`.
3. Save sample grids in `artifacts/image-samples/` and metrics CSV in artifacts.

## Practice Drills
- Run a short sanity check before full training.

## Done When
- [ ] Image training pipeline runs and outputs artifacts.
