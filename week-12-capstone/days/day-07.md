# week-12-capstone - Day 07: Final Report and Handoff

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Scientific report structure](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_to_write_a_scientific_report) - structure sections.
- [Model card concept](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-cards) - skim key sections.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Outline report sections before writing prose.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-12-capstone/notes/final-report.md` with objective/setup/results/failures/next steps.
2. Create `week-12-capstone/notes/reproducibility.md` with exact run commands.
3. Create `week-12-capstone/artifacts/results.md` summarizing best checkpoints and limits.

## Practice Drills
- Ask: can a new reader rerun this from your docs alone? Patch missing steps.

## Done When
- [ ] Final report and reproducibility docs are complete.
