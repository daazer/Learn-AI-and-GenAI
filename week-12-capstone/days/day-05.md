# week-12-capstone - Day 05: Scope Image Capstone

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [PyTorch tutorials index](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) - skim relevant generative examples.
- [Cost optimization mindset](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/cost-optimization) - skim.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Define compute budget and output resolution target.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-12-capstone/notes/day05-image-scope.md`.
2. Choose model family and justify choice.
3. Create `week-12-capstone/code/image_config.yaml` with explicit hyperparameters.

## Practice Drills
- Write fallback plan if full run fails.

## Done When
- [ ] Image scope and config are explicit.
