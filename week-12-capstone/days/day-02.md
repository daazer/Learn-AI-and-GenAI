# week-12-capstone - Day 02: Prepare Text Data

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Datasets processing intro](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/process) - map/filter concepts.
- [unicodedata docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html) - normalization basics.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write deterministic cleaning steps before coding.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-12-capstone/code/day02_prepare_text_data.py`.
2. Clean/split data deterministically and store outputs in `artifacts/text_data/`.
3. Save report `artifacts/day-02-text-data-report.md`.

## Practice Drills
- Run twice and compare output hashes.

## Done When
- [ ] Data pipeline is deterministic and reported.
