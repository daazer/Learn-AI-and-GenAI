# week-03-linear-algebra - Day 02: Vector Ops and Cosine Similarity

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [NumPy ops quick ref](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html) - arithmetic section.
- [Cosine similarity docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity.html) - skim usage.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- List 2 ML uses for cosine similarity.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-03-linear-algebra/code/day02_vector_ops.py`.
2. Implement add/subtract/scalar-mul/cosine functions and shape guards.
3. Export cosine matrix CSV to `week-03-linear-algebra/artifacts/day-02-cosine.csv`.

## Practice Drills
- Add zero-vector case handling.

## Done When
- [ ] All operations run with guard checks.
- [ ] Cosine CSV exists.
