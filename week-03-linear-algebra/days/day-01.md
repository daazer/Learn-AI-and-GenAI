# week-03-linear-algebra - Day 01: Vectors, Dot Product, Norms

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Khan vectors](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/vectors-and-spaces) - 8-10 min.
- [NumPy norm docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html) - examples.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write geometric meaning of dot product in one sentence.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-03-linear-algebra/code/day01_vectors.py`.
2. Implement `dot_manual`, `l2_norm_manual`, and NumPy equivalents with comparison prints.
3. Save comparisons to `week-03-linear-algebra/artifacts/day-01-vectors.txt`.

## Practice Drills
- Test orthogonal vectors and scaled vectors explicitly.

## Done When
- [ ] Manual and NumPy results match.
- [ ] Artifact file exists.
