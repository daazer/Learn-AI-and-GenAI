# week-03-linear-algebra - Day 03: Matrix Shapes and Manual Matmul

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Matrix multiplication intro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication) - shape rules section.
- [NumPy matmul docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html) - behavior notes.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write one shape compatibility rule before coding.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-03-linear-algebra/code/day03_matrices.py`.
2. Implement `shape_check(A,B)` and `matmul_manual(A,B)` for nested lists.
3. Compare outputs with `np.matmul` and log to `artifacts/day-03-matmul.md`.

## Practice Drills
- Add one invalid-shape example and clean error output.

## Done When
- [ ] Manual multiplication works on valid shapes.
- [ ] Invalid shape case is handled.
