# week-03-linear-algebra - Day 04: Matmul Runtime Comparison

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Algorithmic complexity recap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) - skim.
- [timeit docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html) - basic usage.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Define fairness rule for timing runs.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-03-linear-algebra/code/day04_matmul_benchmark.py`.
2. Benchmark manual vs NumPy matmul over 3 sizes; save CSV `artifacts/day-04-runtime.csv`.
3. Plot runtime chart to `artifacts/day-04-runtime.png`.

## Practice Drills
- Repeat with second seed and verify same ranking.

## Done When
- [ ] Runtime CSV and plot are generated.
