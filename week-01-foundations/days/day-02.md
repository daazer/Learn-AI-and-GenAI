# week-01-foundations - Day 02: Variables, Control Flow, and Functions

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Python tutorial: control flow](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html) - read `if`, `for`, and function sections.
- [Real Python: defining functions](https://realpython.com/defining-your-own-python-function/) - skim args and returns.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Capture one example each for conditional, loop, and reusable function.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-01-foundations/code/day02_basics.py`.
2. Implement `is_even(n)`, `grade_score(score)`, and `running_sum(nums)`.
3. Add inline assertions for at least 6 cases total.
4. Run script and save terminal output to `week-01-foundations/artifacts/day-02-output.txt`.
5. Append one paragraph to `week-01-foundations/notes/theory-summary.md` about `for` vs `while`.

## Practice Drills
- Break one assertion intentionally, rerun, then fix it.
- Refactor one function using a cleaner structure.

## Done When
- [ ] All assertions pass.
- [ ] Script output file exists.
- [ ] Theory note has one concrete rule for loop choice.
