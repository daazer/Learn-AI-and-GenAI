# week-01-foundations - Day 07: Weekly Synthesis: Linear vs Nonlinear

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [3Blue1Brown linear transformation intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE) - watch first 8-10 min.
- [Linear function definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function) - skim definition/examples.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Capture one linear and one nonlinear pattern from your own week-1 code.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-01-foundations/notes/linear-vs-nonlinear.md` with 3 concrete examples each.
2. Create `week-01-foundations/notes/weekly-retrospective.md` with wins, blockers, fixes, next-week prep.
3. Create `week-01-foundations/code/run_all.ps1` to run day02-day06 scripts.
4. Run `run_all.ps1` once and log pass/fail in `week-01-foundations/artifacts/results.md`.
5. Clean file naming so scripts use day prefixes consistently.

## Practice Drills
- Explain linear vs nonlinear to a beginner in 5 sentences in your notes.
- Add one TODO for week 2 pipeline improvements.

## Done When
- [ ] Retrospective and concept note are complete.
- [ ] Run-all script exists and executes.
- [ ] Results log captures outcomes.
