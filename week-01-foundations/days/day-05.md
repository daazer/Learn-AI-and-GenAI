# week-01-foundations - Day 05: Matplotlib Essentials

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Matplotlib quick start](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/quick_start.html) - read figure/axes basics.
- [Pyplot tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/pyplot.html) - skim labels and savefig.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Focus on titles, axis labels, legend, and saving to file.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-01-foundations/code/day05_plots.py`.
2. Generate one histogram and one line plot from synthetic data.
3. Save `week-01-foundations/artifacts/histogram.png` and `week-01-foundations/artifacts/line_plot.png`.
4. Add titles and axis labels on both plots.
5. Write interpretation notes in `week-01-foundations/artifacts/day-05-readme.md`.

## Practice Drills
- Change histogram bins (10 vs 30) and note visual change.
- Add grid to line plot and decide if readability improves.

## Done When
- [ ] Both image files exist and render.
- [ ] Both plots are labeled.
- [ ] Interpretation notes mention what the plots mean.
