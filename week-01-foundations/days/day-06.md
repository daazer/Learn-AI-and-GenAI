# week-01-foundations - Day 06: Numerical Experiments: Mean, Variance, Histogram

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [NumPy statistics routines](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.statistics.html) - read `mean` and `var` docs.
- [Variance intuition](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data) - skim explanation.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Rewrite variance intuition in your own words in 2 lines.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-01-foundations/code/day06_stats_experiment.py`.
2. Generate 3 synthetic datasets (normal, uniform, skewed) with fixed seed.
3. Compute and print mean/variance table for each dataset.
4. Save 3 histograms to `week-01-foundations/artifacts/day-06-hist-*.png`.
5. Document one surprising result in `week-01-foundations/notes/mistakes-and-fixes.md`.

## Practice Drills
- Double sample size and compare moment stability.
- Compare NumPy variance to a manual implementation.

## Done When
- [ ] All 3 distributions are analyzed.
- [ ] Histograms and table are saved.
- [ ] One interpretation note is documented.
