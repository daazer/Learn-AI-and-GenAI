# Week 01 Foundations

Focus: Python basics, numeric thinking, and scientific workflow habits

## Week Mission
Build practical mastery of this week's concepts through code-first exercises, reproducible experiments, and documented takeaways.

## Prerequisites
- Previous week completed (or equivalent comfort with listed skills).
- Local Python environment ready (python, pip, virtual environment).
- Basic Git usage for tracking incremental progress.

## Learning Outcomes (Definition of Success)
- [ ] Set up and manage a reproducible Python workspace.
- [ ] Write clear, testable Python scripts and small functions.
- [ ] Use NumPy arrays and vectorized operations for basic numerical work.
- [ ] Visualize simple distributions and trends with Matplotlib.

## Core Tasks
- [ ] 1. Set up Python environment and project structure.
- [ ] 2. Learn Python basics: variables, control flow, functions.
- [ ] 3. Learn Python data structures: lists, dicts, sets, tuples.
- [ ] 4. Learn NumPy arrays and vectorized operations.
- [ ] 5. Learn basic plotting with Matplotlib.
- [ ] 6. Implement simple numerical experiments: mean, variance, histogram.
- [ ] 7. Write a summary note on linear vs nonlinear functions.

## Day-by-Day Execution Blueprint
- Day 1: Read and skim core concepts, define terms, and write a one-page mental model in notes/.
- Day 2: Implement the first half of core coding tasks with minimal abstractions.
- Day 3: Finish remaining coding tasks and validate with simple tests or assertions.
- Day 4: Run controlled experiments, track metrics, and save artifacts.
- Day 5: Refactor for clarity (naming, structure, docstrings, small helper functions).
- Day 6: Write a technical summary note: what worked, what failed, and why.
- Day 7: Review, tighten deliverables, and prepare handoff-ready week outputs.

## Guided Build Project
Build a mini numeric-lab script that loads sample values, computes descriptive stats, and produces at least two plots (histogram + line/scatter).

## Deliverables
- notes/
- code/
- artifacts/

## Minimum File Outputs
- notes/theory-summary.md
- notes/mistakes-and-fixes.md
- notes/weekly-retrospective.md
- code/run_all (script or notebook)
- artifacts/results.md

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] All setup commands documented in notes/setup.md.
- [ ] At least 3 executable scripts in code/.
- [ ] At least 2 plots exported into artifacts/.

## Reflection Prompts
- Which concept still feels intuitive weak, and what concrete example clarified it?
- Which implementation detail caused the most bugs, and how was it fixed?
- Which metric best indicated progress this week, and why?
- What should be simplified before building on this in the next week?

## Stretch Goals (Optional)
- Add one extra experiment that changes a meaningful assumption.
- Compare two implementation strategies and document tradeoffs.
- Add simple automation (Makefile or script) to run repetitive steps.

## End-of-Week Gate
Mark the week complete only when:
- All core tasks are checked.
- Deliverables exist in notes/, code/, and artifacts/.
- You can explain the week's key idea in plain language without notes.
