## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Generative image pitfalls](https://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/) - skim.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Create one tradeoff table: CNN vs AE vs VAE vs diffusion.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Write `week-10-image-models/notes/weekly-retrospective.md`.
2. Create `code/run_all.ps1` and log outputs to `artifacts/results.md`.
3. Create `notes/generative-images-summary.md` with model-specific lessons.

## Practice Drills
- Pick best/worst output samples and annotate why.

## Done When
- [ ] Weekly comparison docs and run logs are complete.
