# week-10-image-models - Day 03: Train CNN on Small Dataset

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Torchvision transforms](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html) - skim basics.
- [Accuracy refresher](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/accuracy-precision-recall) - accuracy section.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Define split + metrics before running training.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-10-image-models/code/day03_train_cnn.py`.
2. Train on small dataset subset; track train/val loss+accuracy and save best checkpoint.
3. Save curves to `artifacts/day-03-cnn-curves.png` and checkpoint under artifacts.

## Practice Drills
- Add one augmentation and compare validation accuracy.

## Done When
- [ ] CNN training run produces checkpoint and curves.
