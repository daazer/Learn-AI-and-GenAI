# week-10-image-models - Day 01: Image Tensors and Convolution Basics

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Image kernels visualized](https://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/) - 8-12 min.
- [Conv2d docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html) - args and shape notes.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write expected image tensor shape convention before coding.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-10-image-models/code/day01_image_conv.py`.
2. Apply manual edge/blur kernels and one conv layer to sample images.
3. Save before/after grid to `artifacts/day-01-conv-grid.png`.

## Practice Drills
- Try different kernel sizes and compare effects.

## Done When
- [ ] Convolution demo produces interpretable artifacts.
