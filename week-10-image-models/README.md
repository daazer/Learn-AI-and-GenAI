# Week 10 Image Models

Focus: Generative image modeling foundations from CNNs to tiny diffusion

## Week Mission
Build practical mastery of this week's concepts through code-first exercises, reproducible experiments, and documented takeaways.

## Prerequisites
- Previous week completed (or equivalent comfort with listed skills).
- Local Python environment ready (python, pip, virtual environment).
- Basic Git usage for tracking incremental progress.

## Learning Outcomes (Definition of Success)
- [ ] Process and model image tensors correctly.
- [ ] Implement convolutional and autoencoding models.
- [ ] Understand latent-variable and diffusion-based generation intuition.
- [ ] Generate and compare outputs from multiple image approaches.

## Core Tasks
- [ ] 68. Learn image representation and convolution basics.
- [ ] 69. Implement a simple CNN from scratch.
- [ ] 70. Train the CNN on a small image dataset.
- [ ] 71. Learn autoencoders and implement one.
- [ ] 72. Implement a variational autoencoder.
- [ ] 73. Learn diffusion model intuition.
- [ ] 74. Implement a tiny diffusion model on small images.
- [ ] 75. Write a summary note on generative images.

## Day-by-Day Execution Blueprint
- Day 1: Read and skim core concepts, define terms, and write a one-page mental model in notes/.
- Day 2: Implement the first half of core coding tasks with minimal abstractions.
- Day 3: Finish remaining coding tasks and validate with simple tests or assertions.
- Day 4: Run controlled experiments, track metrics, and save artifacts.
- Day 5: Refactor for clarity (naming, structure, docstrings, small helper functions).
- Day 6: Write a technical summary note: what worked, what failed, and why.
- Day 7: Review, tighten deliverables, and prepare handoff-ready week outputs.

## Guided Build Project
Create an image-generation lab with CNN baseline, autoencoder/VAE, and tiny diffusion prototype.

## Deliverables
- notes/
- code/
- artifacts/

## Minimum File Outputs
- notes/theory-summary.md
- notes/mistakes-and-fixes.md
- notes/weekly-retrospective.md
- code/run_all (script or notebook)
- artifacts/results.md

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Reconstruction quality tracked for AE/VAE.
- [ ] At least one diffusion sampling script runs end-to-end.
- [ ] Artifacts include input/reconstruction/sample grids.

## Reflection Prompts
- Which concept still feels intuitive weak, and what concrete example clarified it?
- Which implementation detail caused the most bugs, and how was it fixed?
- Which metric best indicated progress this week, and why?
- What should be simplified before building on this in the next week?

## Stretch Goals (Optional)
- Add one extra experiment that changes a meaningful assumption.
- Compare two implementation strategies and document tradeoffs.
- Add simple automation (Makefile or script) to run repetitive steps.

## End-of-Week Gate
Mark the week complete only when:
- All core tasks are checked.
- Deliverables exist in notes/, code/, and artifacts/.
- You can explain the week's key idea in plain language without notes.
