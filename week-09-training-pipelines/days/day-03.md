# week-09-training-pipelines - Day 03: Checkpointing

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Saving/loading models](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html) - state_dict workflow.
- [Experiment tracking concept](https://wandb.ai/site/articles/experiment-tracking) - skim.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- List required checkpoint fields before coding.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-09-training-pipelines/code/day03_checkpointing.py`.
2. Implement save/load helpers and prove resume from expected step.
3. Log proof to `artifacts/day-03-checkpoint-resume.txt`.

## Practice Drills
- Handle missing checkpoint path with clean error.

## Done When
- [ ] Resume workflow is demonstrated.
