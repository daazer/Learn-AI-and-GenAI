# week-09-training-pipelines - Day 07: Reproducibility Audit

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [PyTorch randomness note](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html) - 10 min.
- Review your checkpoints/logs from days 1-6.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write a reproducibility checklist: seed, config, code version, artifacts.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Write `week-09-training-pipelines/notes/reproducibility.md`.
2. Create `code/run_all.ps1` and run day01-day06 scripts.
3. Record outputs and caveats in `artifacts/results.md`.

## Practice Drills
- Re-run one script from scratch and compare metrics.

## Done When
- [ ] Reproducibility note and run log are complete.
