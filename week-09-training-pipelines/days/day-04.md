# week-09-training-pipelines - Day 04: Metric Logging and Curves

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [Interpreting loss curves](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/overfitting/interpreting-loss-curves) - skim.
- [Matplotlib plot API](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html) - quick read.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Choose primary and secondary metrics for your loop.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-09-training-pipelines/code/day04_metrics.py`.
2. Log train/val loss + metric + LR to CSV each epoch.
3. Save combined chart to `artifacts/day-04-metrics.png` and notes md.

## Practice Drills
- Mark overfitting onset epoch from curves.

## Done When
- [ ] Metrics CSV + chart + interpretation note exist.
