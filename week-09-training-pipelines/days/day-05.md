# week-09-training-pipelines - Day 05: Initialization Comparison

## Reading (5-15 minutes)
- [nn.init docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.init.html) - Xavier/He functions.
- [Initialization explainer](https://machinelearningmastery.com/weight-initialization-for-deep-learning-neural-networks/) - skim.

## How To Read (2-3 minutes)
- Write when He init is preferred.

## Build (Detailed Coding / Practice)
1. Create `week-09-training-pipelines/code/day05_init_compare.py`.
2. Train same model under naive/Xavier/He init with fixed seed and hyperparams.
3. Save summary CSV and plot under `artifacts/day-05-init-*`.

## Practice Drills
- Repeat with second seed and compare ranking.

## Done When
- [ ] Initialization comparison is reproducible.
